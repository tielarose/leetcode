# Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

# Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

# Search for a node to remove.
# If the node is found, delete the node.


# Example 1:


# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
# Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
# Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
# One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
# Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

# Example 2:

# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
# Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
# Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
# Example 3:

# Input: root = [], key = 0
# Output: []


# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
# -105 <= Node.val <= 105
# Each node has a unique value.
# root is a valid binary search tree.
# -105 <= key <= 105
