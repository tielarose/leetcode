# Given a string s which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

# Letters are case sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome here.


# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abccccdd"
# Output: 7
# Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "a"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The longest palindrome that can be built is "a", whose length is 1.


# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 2000
# s consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.


class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        ans = 0
        seen = set()

        for letter in s:
            if letter in seen:
                ans += 2
                seen.remove(letter)
            else:
                seen.add(letter)

        if seen:
            ans += 1

        return ans
